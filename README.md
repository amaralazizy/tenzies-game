# 🎲 Tenzies Game

Tenzies is a fun and addictive dice-rolling game built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. The objective of the game is simple: roll the dice until all of them show the same number. You can "freeze" dice to lock their value while rolling the rest. It's a great way to test your luck and strategy!
